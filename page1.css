<h1>MY PERSONAL INFORMATION<h1>

<p>I am Christabel Kuukua Maame Nhyira Swanzy Entsiwah, I'm tall and dark and a student at the University of Ghana ,computer science department offering Bachelor of Science in Information Technology level 200. I love to keep to myself but I'm very fun to be with, I like to visit nice places when I'm free, I do paintings,  braids, and wigs as well.I live in Dansoman with my parent and younger sister but I'm currently at Parakuo Estate, dome since I didn't get accommodation on campus. I love life so I don't joke with my food ,I love to eat healthy and take good care of myself and pray too. I like all neutral colours and also like playing games.I'm a fante from Discorve in the western region .Like my course so much because IT is ruling the world now, everything is about the computer so when you are involved life becomes somehow easy.I would like to visit all the continents to learn more about people and their way of life and to learn about their systems and the secret to their develoment as a country.
